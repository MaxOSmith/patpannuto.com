We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

	abstract = {As we show in this paper, I/O has become the limiting
			factor in scaling down size and power toward the goal of
			invisible computing. Achieving this goal will require
			composing optimized and specialized---yet
			reusable---components with an interconnect that permits
			tiny, ultra-low power systems.  In contrast to today's
			interconnects which are limited by power-hungry
			pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our
			approach provides a superset of common bus features but
			at lower power, with fixed area and pin count, using
			fully synthesizable logic, and with surprisingly low
			protocol overhead.

			We present \textbf{MBus}, a new 4-pin,
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip chip-to-chip interconnect made of two
			``shoot-through'' rings.  MBus facilitates ultra-low
			power system operation by implementing automatic
			power-gating of each chip in the system, easing the
			integration of active, inactive, and activating
			circuits on a single die.  In addition, we introduce a
			new bus primitive: power oblivious communication, which
			guarantees message reception regardless of the
			recipient's power state when a message is sent.  This
			disentangles power management from communication,
			greatly simplifying the creation of viable, modular,
			and heterogeneous systems that operate on the order of
			nanowatts.

			To evaluate the viability, power, performance,
			overhead, and scalability of our design, we build both
			hardware and software implementations of MBus and show
			its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve
			custom chips from three different semiconductor
			processes.  A three-chip, 2.2\,mm$^3$ MBus system draws
			8\,nW of total system standby power and uses only
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip for communication.  This is the
			lowest power for any system bus with MBus's feature
			set.

		impact disease spread, communication behavior, and other phenomenon, has
		proven challenging.
		Smartphones are limited by their inaccurate and/or
		impractical ranging capabilities, while wearable sensors
		are limited by their need for
		infrastructure nodes, bulkiness, and/or inaccurate ranging.
		To address these challenges, we present Opo, a 14~cm$^2$, 11.4~g ``lapel pin''
		built from commercial components.
		Opo sensors range neighbors every 2~s up to 2~m away with 5\% average
		error, all while requiring zero
		infrastructure and improving upon current wearable sensors' accuracy and power usage.
		The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19~\uA
		when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range
		neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry
		RF discovery protocols.
		Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5~cm)
		and temporal fidelity (2~s) on a limited power budget.

	abstract = {We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones
			and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires.  The
			luminaires---modified to allow rapid, on-off keying---transmit their
			identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical
			pulses.  A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame
			capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image,
			decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine
			the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires.
			Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position
			updates.
			The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of
			emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data
			through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers
			can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical
			transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is
			intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of
			multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's
			image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained
			angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be
			solved with optimization techniques.  We explore the feasibility of
			the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of
			the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a
			practical deployment including usability and scalability, and
			demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and
