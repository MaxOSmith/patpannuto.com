Ultra wideband technology has shown incredible promise for providing
high-quality location estimation, even in indoor complex multipath
environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of
milliwatts during operation.
Backscatter communication has demonstrated the viability of astonishingly
low-power tags, but has thus far been restricted to low (localization)
resolution narrowband systems.
We combine these technologies to capture the best of both worlds and create
\emph{Slocalization}, an ultra wideband backscatter localization system that
realizes decimeter-accurate localization of a static tag in complex indoor
environments for less than one microwatt.
This ultra-low energy budget could allow the tag to operate for over 50~years
on single coin cell battery or completely battery-free with less than
5\,cm$^2$ of photovoltaic cells indoors.
The key insight underlying Slocalization is that the vast majority of things
in the world do not move. Thus instead of localizing on the order of
milliseconds, Slocalization estimates locations on the order of millihertz.
To prove the viability of this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting
Slocalization tag and find that Slocalization can locate this tag with a
mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30\,cm.

City-scale sensing holds the promise of enabling deeper understanding of our
urban environments.
However, a city-scale deployment requires physical installation,
power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a
good idea and a realized one.
This suggests the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and
experimentation for city-scale applications.
To address these challenges, we present Signpost, a modular platform for city-scale sensing.
Signpost simplifies deployment by removing the need
for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an
integrated solar panel. The platform furnishes the key resources necessary to 
support multiple, pluggable sensor modules while providing
fair, safe, and reliable sharing in the face of energy constraints.
We deploy Signpost with several sensor modules, showing the viability
of an energy-harvesting, multi-tenant, sensing system, and evaluate its
ability to realize and enable support for city-scale sensing applications.
We believe Signpost can reduce the difficulty inherent to city-scale deployments,
enabling new experimentation, insights into urban health, and ultimately,
improved cities.

 abstract = {Low-power microcontrollers lack some of the hardware features and
     memory resources that enable multiprogrammable systems.  Accordingly,
     microcontroller-based operating systems have not provided important
     features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and
     flexible concurrency. However, an emerging class of embedded
     applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose
     devices, and need these multiprogramming features.  Tock, a new
     operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited
     hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the
     Rust programming language to provide a multiprogramming environment
     for microcontrollers.  Tock isolates software faults, provides

     retaining the dependability requirements of long-running applications.

We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization.
SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware.
While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary
for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of
frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median
ranging error.
Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range
estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for
localization that ameliorates this overhead.
We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and
fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08\,m median error
and 0.53\,m 99th percentile error.
As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next
develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space.
This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference
phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme
compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the
viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband
radios.
Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the
ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated
``drop-in'' ranging module that provides a simple \iic interface. We show that
this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while
facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to
handle other tasks.

We introduce \emph{Harmonium}, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture
that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors.
Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to
provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates.
Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive,
lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or \emph{tag}, fixed
infrastructure \emph{anchors} with known locations, and centralized processing
that calculates the tag's position.
Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that
rejects narrowband interferers and
extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of
traditional ultra-wideband approaches.
In a complex indoor environment, 90\% of position estimates obtained with
Harmonium exhibit less than 31\,cm of error with an average 9\,cm of inter-sample
noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90\% of position error is less than
42\,cm.
The tag draws 75\,mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9\,mJ per location fix
at the 19\,Hz update rate.  Tags weigh 3\,g and cost \$4.50\,USD at modest
volumes.
Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization
and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors,
devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture
systems.

			composing optimized and specialized---yet

			tiny, ultra-low power systems.  In contrast to today's
			interconnects which are limited by power-hungry
			pull-ups or high-overhead chip-select lines, our
			approach provides a superset of common bus features but
			at lower power, with fixed area and pin count, using
			fully synthesizable logic, and with surprisingly low
			protocol overhead.

			We present \textbf{MBus}, a new 4-pin,
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip chip-to-chip interconnect made of two
			``shoot-through'' rings.  MBus facilitates ultra-low
			power system operation by implementing automatic
			power-gating of each chip in the system, easing the
			integration of active, inactive, and activating
			circuits on a single die.  In addition, we introduce a
			new bus primitive: power oblivious communication, which
			guarantees message reception regardless of the
			recipient's power state when a message is sent.  This
			disentangles power management from communication,
			greatly simplifying the creation of viable, modular,
			and heterogeneous systems that operate on the order of
			nanowatts.

			To evaluate the viability, power, performance,
			overhead, and scalability of our design, we build both
			hardware and software implementations of MBus and show
			its seamless operation across two FPGAs and twelve
			custom chips from three different semiconductor
			processes.  A three-chip, 2.2\,mm$^3$ MBus system draws
			8\,nW of total system standby power and uses only
			22.6\,pJ/bit/chip for communication.  This is the
			lowest power for any system bus with MBus's feature
