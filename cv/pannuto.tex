\section*{Research Overview and Interests}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[]
    My research focuses on solving the ``last inch'' problem and solving the
    challenges that stand between the burgeoning Internet of Things and
    inevitable Internet of Everything.
    My research vision pushes towards the realization of ubiquitous and
    pervasive computing,
    aiming to understand how our interaction and utilization of technology
    will shift as computing becomes omnipresent and its operation and
    interaction shifts from conscious action to unconscious extension of
    perception and ability.
    What advancements will most change how people interact with themselves,
    the world, and one another, and what innovations facilitate these paradigm
    shifts?
    My interests span from low-level details---developing new technology to
    meet the energy and area demands of next-generation millimeter
    systems---to large-scale global considerations---understanding how our
    network and infrastructure must scale and adapt to support the trillions
    of impending devices.

\section*{Teaching}

\begin{itemize}

  \item[] Primary Instructor, EECS 398: Computing for Computer Scientists (F'16, W'16)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] A new class designed and built from scratch. This class attempts
        to address the experience gap that exists across the spectrum of
        incoming Computer Science students. While driven by tools (shells,
        build systems, debuggers, version control), it explores how and why
        computer scientists interface with computers differently in their
        day-to-day activities, how to apply principles learned in courses to
        everyday activities, and ultimately how to be a more efficient user of
        computing resources.
