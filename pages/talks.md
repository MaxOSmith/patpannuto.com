### Sensing Technologies for Data Collection and Monitoring, [State of the Science](http://dil.berkeley.edu/stateofthescience/) -- _Invited Talk_

The State of the Science conference put on by [DIL](http://dil.berkeley.edu/),
[gui2de](http://gui2de.georgetown.edu/), [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/), and
the [USAID Higher Education Solutions Network](http://www.usaid.gov/hesn).
I was asked to give a presentation on the state of sensors and sensor networks
as they are available today with an emphasis on the challenges of actually
deploying systems. I was also asked to touch on the current state of research in
the area and what kinds of interesting systems are coming down the pipe.

### Introduction to Git, [Michigan Hackers](http://michiganhackers.org/) -- _Invited Talk_

The Michigan Hackers are a student group at the University of Michigan who
attempt to bring together people interested in building system.
For the last few years, they've thrown [the largest
hackathon](http://mhacks.org/) in the world. In their nacency, I was invited to
give one of the first tech talks. The audience was primarily experienced
hackers, so the goal of the talk was to dive into the internals of
[git](http://git-scm.com/). I presented a slide deck put together by Scott
Chacon, [available here](https://github.com/schacon/git-presentations).
