### MBus: A power-aware interconnect for ultra-low power micro-scale system design, at [DARPA N-ZERO Program Review][nzero]
The [DARPA N-ZERO program][nzero] is a really interesting initiative
looking to push the envelope for lowest-power sensors:
<small>
<blockquote>
The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program has the goal of developing the technological foundation for persistent, event-driven sensing capabilities in which the sensor can remain dormant, with near-zero power consumption, until awakened by an external trigger or stimulus.

If successful, the program could extend the lifetime of remotely deployed communications and environmental sensors—also known as unattended ground sensors (UGS)—from weeks or months to years.
</blockquote>
</small>

The N-ZERO program emphasizes the development of novel low-power sensors and
wakeup frontends, initially with the intent of using the frontends to
opportunistically wake traditional sensing and communication systems.

I was invited to the program review to discuss the viability and technical
challenges of integrating [MBus][mbus] frontends with N-ZERO chips, towards
the long-term vision of replacing the high-energy traditional sensing and
compute frontends with ultra-low power systems, such as the [Michigan Micro
Mote][michigan-micro-mote].

### Ultra-Wideband and Indoor Localization, at [HotWireless'16][hotwireless16]
[HotWireless](hotwireless16) is one of my favorite workshops, I feel like I
always come away with a few things that I find really interesting coming down
the pipe. This year I was invited to come give a talk on our recent work in
ultra-wideband localization technologies.

This is a particularly fun talk for me as it centers around two systems that
were originally proposed at previous HotWireless workshops. First we discuss
[SurePoint][kempke16surepoint], a refinement of the [PolyPoint][kempke15polypoint]
system presented at HotWireless'15, that realizes a robust, reliable, and
scalable indoor localization system. Then we look at what we can achieve with a
non-COTS UWB system with [Harmonium][kempke16harmonium] a descendent of
[Harmonia][kempke14harmonia] from HotWireless'14, that exploits asymmetry
between the tag and anchor to realize an inexpensive (&lt;$5), lightweight (3g),
and low-power tag (75mW). Finally, we close with some thoughts on open ideas
for UWB research, including backscatter, protocol refinements, and better
utilization of the channel impulse response.

### The Recent Past and Distant Future of [Micro-Scale] Embedded Systems, at [NextMote: Next Generation Platforms for the Cyber-Physical Internet][nextmote16]
NextMote was a new workshop at [EWSN'16][ewsn16]. Inspired by the work we have
been doing in [millimeter-scale system design][mbus], I was invited to come
I was invited to come give the keynote presentation to open the new workshop.

The talk traverses the evolution from yesterday's motes to "next" and
"next-next" generation motes. Along the way we'll face a few harsh realities
that will limit and shape future evolution (a trillion devices cannot demand
replacing a trillion batteries), uncover recent results already pushing
boundaries (including highlights from the design and implementation of the
world's smallest computer), and explore some of the possibilities that emerge
when we rethink designs from the ground up (can we build useful motes that
don't include CPUs?).

### PolyPoint and the First Steps Towards Ubiquitous Localization, at the [Student Summit on Mobility, Systems, and Networking][MSsummit16]
This event mirrored MSR&rsquo;s traditional faculty retreats, only targeted at
senior-level graduate students. This was one of the most enjoyable events I
have had the pleasure of attending. Lots of really bright people working on
really interesting things with great opportunities to converse with peers and
senior members in the field equally. I would highly recommend that anyone given
the opportunity attend (and that faculty actually nominate your students when
asked!).

### MBus: An Ultra-Low Power Interconnect for Next Generation Nanopower Systems, [42nd International Symposium on Computer Architecture][isca15]
This presentation introduces [MBus][mbus], the missing interconnect technology
that enables the millimeter-scale computing class. From the
[Michigan Micro Mote (M<sup>3</sup>)](http://cubicmm.eecs.umich.edu) project, an
effort develop next-next generation millimeter-scale computers today, we
discovered that the traditional technologies for composing embedded systems,
I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI, cannot scale to millimeter-scale designs. We drafted a
set of fundamental requirements for a millimeter-scale interconnect, and show
that no existing interconnect satisfies these requirements. We then take these
requirements and design a new interconnect, MBus, optimizing for
millimeter-scale systems while providing a superset of features from existing
interconnect technologies. For more information on MBus and the M<sup>3</sup>
project, visit [mbus.io][mbus].

### Lessons from Five Years of Making Michigan Micro Motes (M<sup>3</sup>), [6th Workshop on Architectural Research Prototyping][warp15]
[WARP'15][warp15] hearkened the return of a workshop that had been on a
five-year hiatus. The workshop seeks to both motivate the importance and value
of actually building systems in the architecture community as well as to share
lessons and experiences from fabrication. This talk begins by highlighting an
architectural problem, the absence of an interconnect technology that is
appropriate for mm-scale modules, and our solution to that issue: [MBus][mbus].
The talk then covers a breadth of the system, manufacturing, and design issues
that we have solved and are struggling with for the Michigan Micro Mote project.
Finally, the talk closes with an introduction of an emerging issue in low-power
system design, the need for an indirection layer for peripheral control and
semi-automated operations, and our solution to that issue, the MPQ protocol
for MBus.

the [IPSN 2011](http://ipsn.acm.org/2011/) conference in downtown Chicago. I
attended this workshop as an undergraduate, presenting some of the first
research I ever worked on. The impetus for the work was trying to reconcile
the cognitive dissonance of using wireless as the medium to connect AC power
meters, devices that are literally wired together already. The result was that
powerline networking is not as trivial as I'd hoped, with a fairly
non-intuitive connectivity graph. The takeaway was that hybrid routing,
leveraging the physically long hops provided by powerline communication and
using wireless to bridge disjoint powerline networks, would likely provide the
most efficient building-wide network.
