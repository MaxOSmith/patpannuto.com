### Sensor Systems and the Art of Effectively Deploying Sensor Networks, [TechChange TC111: Technology for Monitoring and Evaluation][tc111]

[TC111][tc111] was a online course focusing on skills and strategies for
collecting, managing, analyzing, and visualizing Information Communication
Technologies put on by [TechChange][techchange]. I was asked to give a guest
lecture on the capabilities and added value of sensor deployments as well as
the challenges in recovering data from deployments, with a focus on how
non-technical organizations can realize and utilize sensing. This presentation
was in collaboration with [Guillaume Kroll](http://cega.berkeley.edu/staff/)
at the [Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA)](http://cega.berkeley.edu/).

### System Architecture Directions for a Software-Defined Lighting Infrastructure, [1st ACM Workshop on Visible Light Communication Systems][vlcs14]

[VLCS'14][vlcs14] was a new workshop attached to [MobiCom'14][mobicom14]. This
talk presented our initial research into the design of Software-Defined
Lighting (SDL), in particular looking at the diversity of applications already
created and coming down the pipe and looking at ways of mapping all of these
applications to a single, unified lighting network. A copy of the workshop
[paper](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu/content/pubs/kuo14vlc_arch.pdf) is also
available.

### Embedded System Design and the Internet of Things, [Stanford Internet of Things Industrial Research Program](http://iot.stanford.edu/workshop14.html)

The workshop was a kickoff for the Stanford Internet of Things Industrial
Research Program. I was asked to describe the state of security for the
Intenet of Things, in particular looking from the persepctive of an embedded
systems hardware and network developer. The talk gives an overview of some
recent research, some challenges and directions in networking, and a
discussion of the hardware trends, expectations, and requirements for embedded
systems, all with an eye towards security.

### Sensing Technologies for Data Collection and Monitoring, [State of the Science](http://dil.berkeley.edu/stateofthescience/)

The State of the Science conference put on by [DIL](http://dil.berkeley.edu/),
[gui2de](http://gui2de.georgetown.edu/), [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/), and
the [USAID Higher Education Solutions Network](http://www.usaid.gov/hesn).
I was asked to give a presentation on the state of sensors and sensor networks
as they are available today with an emphasis on the challenges of actually
deploying systems. I was also asked to touch on the current state of research in
the area and what kinds of interesting systems are coming down the pipe.

### MBus: Enabling the Next Generation of Sensors and Systems, [Terraswarm Annual Meeting](http://www.terraswarm.org/conferences/13/annual/index.htm)

The [TerraSwarm Research Center](http://www.terraswarm.org/) holds an annual
meeting for all participating members. During the meeting, I was asked to give
a "from the trenches" talk, describing my current research, which at the time
was focused heavily on [MBus](http://mbus.io/).

### Introduction to Git, [Michigan Hackers](http://michiganhackers.org/)

The Michigan Hackers are a student group at the University of Michigan who
attempt to bring together people interested in building system.
For the last few years, they've thrown [the largest
hackathon](http://mhacks.org/) in the world. In their nacency, I was invited to
give one of the first tech talks. The audience was primarily experienced
hackers, so the goal of the talk was to dive into the internals of
[git](http://git-scm.com/). I presented a slide deck put together by Scott
Chacon, [available here](https://github.com/schacon/git-presentations).

### Exploring Powerline Networking for the Smart Building, [IP+SN 2011](http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/ip+sn2011/)

[IP+SN 2011](http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/ip+sn2011/) was a workshop attached to
the [IPSN 2011](http://ipsn.acm.org/2011/) conference in downtown Chicago. I
attended this workshop as an undergraduate, presenting some of the first
research I ever worked on. The impetus for the work was trying to reconcile
the cognitive dissonance of using wireless as the medium to connect AC power
meters, devices that are literally wired together already. The result was that
powerline networking is not as trivial as I'd hoped, with a fairly
non-intuitive connectivity graph. The takeaway was that hybrid routing,
leveraging the physically long hops provided by powerline communication and
using wireless to bridge disjoint powerline networks, would likely provide the
most efficient building-wide network.
