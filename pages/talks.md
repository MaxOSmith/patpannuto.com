### Embedded System Design and the Internet of Things, [Stanford Internet of Things Industrial Research Program](http://iot.stanford.edu/workshop14.html)

The workshop was a kickoff for the Stanford Internet of Things Industrial
Research Program. I was asked to describe the state of security for the
Intenet of Things, in particular looking from the persepctive of an embedded
systems hardware and network developer. The talk gives an overview of some
recent research, some challenges and directions in networking, and a
discussion of the hardware trends, expectations, and requirements for embedded
systems, all with an eye towards security.

### Sensing Technologies for Data Collection and Monitoring, [State of the Science](http://dil.berkeley.edu/stateofthescience/)

The State of the Science conference put on by [DIL](http://dil.berkeley.edu/),
[gui2de](http://gui2de.georgetown.edu/), [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/), and
the [USAID Higher Education Solutions Network](http://www.usaid.gov/hesn).
I was asked to give a presentation on the state of sensors and sensor networks
as they are available today with an emphasis on the challenges of actually
deploying systems. I was also asked to touch on the current state of research in
the area and what kinds of interesting systems are coming down the pipe.

### MBus: Enabling the Next Generation of Sensors and Systems, [Terraswarm Annual Meeting](http://www.terraswarm.org/conferences/13/annual/index.htm)

The [TerraSwarm Research Center](http://www.terraswarm.org/) holds an annual
meeting for all participating members. During the meeting, I was asked to give
a "from the trenches" talk, describing my current research, which at the time
was focused heavily on [MBus](http://mbus.io/).

### Introduction to Git, [Michigan Hackers](http://michiganhackers.org/)

The Michigan Hackers are a student group at the University of Michigan who
attempt to bring together people interested in building system.
For the last few years, they've thrown [the largest
hackathon](http://mhacks.org/) in the world. In their nacency, I was invited to
give one of the first tech talks. The audience was primarily experienced
hackers, so the goal of the talk was to dive into the internals of
[git](http://git-scm.com/). I presented a slide deck put together by Scott
Chacon, [available here](https://github.com/schacon/git-presentations).
