Fellowships
-----------

The single most useful piece of advice I was ever given for fellowship essays:
> These are not literature, don't write like it.
An essay for a fellowship is not a novel, it is not even the standard "essay" as
you were taught in high school.

You do not have to obey the simple paragraphs of text layout style. Add bold
words to draw attention to your key points, use whitespace however you want.
Your goal is to make things as easy for the reader as possible.

The NSF requires that you specifically address the "Intellectual
Merit" and "Broader Impact" of your proposal&mdash;put in section headings with
exactly these titles and write about them. You don't need "transition
sentences". In this context, they're nothing but a waste of precious space that
could instead say something to bolster your case; worse, as a reader, they're
just crap that I have to wade through to get to the relevant parts of your
essay. The last thing you want to do is annoy your reader. Think of the volumes
of essays they're reading, then put away the thesaurus and get to the point.

At the end of the day, that's really the goal: minimize the crap the reader has
to process to get what you're trying to communicate. Don't let the word "essay"
get in your way, if a bulleted list makes the most sense, _put in bullets_.

Below I've provided my essays (winning and losing) as well as any reviews that
were made available to me. Hopefully they can serve as helpful examples.
Particularly note the change in style from my (losing) 2012 NSF, which I would
consider a "traditional essay", to the (winning) 2013 NSF, which I would
consider a "fellowship essay".

### NDSEG
Fellowship Homepage: [ndseg.asee.org](http://ndseg.asee.org/)

The NDSEG has fairly restrictive rules (<a href="/fellowships/2013-ndseg-rules.txt">2013 rules</a>).
In particular, you're limited to only 3,000 _characters_, which requires
your "essay" to be extremely concise.

 * 2013 (Won)

### Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship
Fellowship Homepage: [www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship](http://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship)

This fellowship is really interesting as it requires you to have a partner. I
worked with [Brad Campbell](http://bradcampbell.com), a pretty
awesome dude in my lab. The fellowship is (was) only open to a limited set of
schools as Qualcomm grows the program. They've been adding schools every year
thus far, so check the website for updated information.

 * 2013 (Won Honorable Mention [$50k instead of $100k])
