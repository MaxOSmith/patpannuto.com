## AppKit Archive

I'm extremely grateful to all the folks who put information about their search
process online. At the bottom of this page is my appkit as it appeared while I
was on the market. Here, I've also collected some of the materials I found most
helpful as well as a few thoughts of my own. Hopefully they can help you too.

 - [Wes Weimer (et al)'s Guide.](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/grad-job-guide/guide/index.html)
   The most comprehensive across the whole process, covers everything from
   prepping letters and statements through deciding among and negotiating offers.
 - [Tom Wenisch's Materials.](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/?page=jobs.php)
   In particular the "Job Talk" talk is extremeley useful.
   I'll re-emphasize one of the key points again here: The people in your area already
   like you and your work, or you would not have been invited. You need to convince
   _everyone else_ in the department that you work is both technically deep and interesting.
 - [Zakir Durumeri√ß's Interview Notes.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiYiRE9cS_nCd2WS4bVOkrZmsGJv5hwAKbIUqZ0m4K0/edit?usp=sharing)
   A fairly diverse array of representative questions you may be asked during 1:1 interviews.
 - [My thoughts on Video Interviews.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHs-DHV_PxAkCarNVevWQViHL4SySBd_O3o81DthePQ/edit?usp=sharing)
   Pre-interview video calls seem to be growing rapidly in popularity.
   I wrote up some thoughts on my experiences with these as I haven't seen as much written about them.

Lots of people also helpfully have their application materials posted online (mine are below on this page).
If there's someone you particularly like or respect, feel free to reach out and ask for a copy of their application materials; folks are generally happy to share. Purely pragmatically, I found younger folk are more likely to still have them quickly at hand.

Here's a wholly abitrary collection of links to other people's materials that are online (the listed year is when they were on the market). Feel free to send me pointers to others and I'll happily add them.

### Timeline

To me, one of the most stressful parts of the process from the candidate's
perspective is the high variability. Every institution operates on its own
timeline. The Stanford EE application was due by November 15. The UCSD CS
application did not open until November 28 (deadline January 15)!

Inspired by Wes's timeliens, I've tried to capture my major milestones:

 - **Dec 1.** First "wave" of applications submitted (then I took a breather..)
 - **Dec 10-15.** Knocked out the applications with a Dec 15 deadline
 - **Dec 20-23.** Finished the rest of my applications

Later I got a bit more organized in recording major events.
This is a subpart of my application-tracking spreadsheet. The order of schools
is wholly arbitrary and in no way reflects any preferences I may have had (it
was coarsely originally sorted by application deadline, then later got jumbled
as I separated apps that were complete versus those that had missing letters
and such).

Some interesting tidbits:

 - Cornell had a CS representative sit in on my ECE interview. This is the person who later invited me to interview with the CS side as well. (Actually, they were how I learned I got an ECE on-site, the official ECE message didn't come until a few hours later!)
 - The Washington ECE email about a missing letter made my heart drop. Worked out in the long run, but I suspect that is partially because I had actively reached out to several UW faculty that I knew about my application. Folks running searches, [please make sure candidates can view their letter status](https://twitter.com/PatPannuto/status/1089992804435030016).
 - I listed the UCSD invitation as a range because I got an e-mail asking to schedule a call on Feb 9, but due to travel couldn't actually be available until the 13th. Turns out this wasn't an interview (despite my semi-frantic prepping for background on the caller :) ), rather UCSD likes to call folks to invite them to on-site interviews!

## My Original AppKit

The top of my homepage looked like this, below was the page that "Full Appkit" pointed to.

I am excited to be on the job market this year!

I am searching for tenure-track junior faculty positions as well as
opportunites at industrial research labs.
